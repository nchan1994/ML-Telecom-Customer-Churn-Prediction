# ML-Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project involves predicting the customer churn rate of a telecommunication company. This is important analysis to conduct as Telecom companies would use results from customer attrition analysis as a key business metric. Understanding this metric helps give an estimate of the cost of retaining existing customers, which usually is cost much less than acquiring a new one.   In this scenario, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can help analyze the customer attrition rate. I used several ML models to demonstrate and evaluate which ML model would perform better in this business case.
