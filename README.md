# ML-Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Background and Introduction

This project involves predicting the customer churn rate of a telecommunication company. This is important analysis to conduct as Telecom companies would use results from customer attrition analysis as a key business metric. Understanding this metric helps give an estimate of the cost of retaining existing customers, which usually is cost much less than acquiring a new one.   In this scenario, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can help analyze the customer attrition rate. I used several ML models to demonstrate and evaluate which ML model would perform better in this business case.

# Objective

The objective is to analyse the given dataset and to predict the churn rate of telecom customers. Predicting churn rate will be crucial for telecom companies as the cost of retaining an existing client will be far less than acquiring a new one. So it's important for a company to understand 

# Solution & Approach

Machine Learning (ML) will be used to analyse the customer churn rate based on several features and characteristics. The best ML model is used based on evaluation of the ROC-AUC and Classification Report.
